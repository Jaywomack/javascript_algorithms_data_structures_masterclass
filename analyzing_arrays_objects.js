// The big O of objects
/**
 * BIG O of objects
 * insertion- is constant O(1)
 * Removal- is constant O(1)
 * Searching- is in proportion to the number of items o(n)
 * Access- is constant O(1)

*/

/***
 * Arrays
 *
 * When are arrays slow?
 * Arrays are ordered lists
 * Arrays should be used when you need order
 * When using an index O(1)
 *
 * when inserting into an array it depends where the value is inserted
 * pushing onto the end of thar array O(n)
 * when inserting at the beginning of an array O(n)
 *
 * Adding and removing from the beginning of an array is not efficient as if you were to add add and remove from the end of an array
 *
 * So push and pop are more efficient than shift and unshift
